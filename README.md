## Follow Brian Holt's course from Frontendmasters, and this is so far the best than all the others.

Some notes about setting
1.  `npm init -y`
2.  `npm install -D prettier` (or `npm i -D`)
3.   make a new file, prettierrc at root folder (.prettierrc)
4.   `npm i -D eslint eslint-config-prettier`
5.   make a new file, eslintrc at root folder (.eslintrc.json)
6.   create `.gitignore` under your root folder.
7.   (we use parcel for now) `npm i -D parcel-bundler`
8.   `npm run dev` (parcel works and we can have a live server now)
9.   `npm i react react-dom` (install two packages of the npm registrate)
10.  `npm install -D babel-eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react` (then eslint know how to handle with React and tell you if you make any mistakes)
11.  `npm i -D eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
12.  `npm i -D cross-env`

#### TIPS:
```js
//eslint-disable-next-line
```
We can put it in front of these codes that remind you you might have made some mistakes, then it stops warning you.
